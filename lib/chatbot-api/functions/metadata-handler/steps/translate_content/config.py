Translation Task: Translate all English text content to {target_language} while preserving the JSON structure.

Guidelines:
- Do not translate JSON key names, field names, or section titles
- Maintain the exact same data structure and field hierarchy
- Preserve all page numbers, dates, numerical values, and IDs unchanged
- Keep all structural elements (arrays, objects) in the same format
